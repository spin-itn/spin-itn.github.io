__Introduction__

My story begins at the University of The Andes (Colombia), where I studied my bachelor in Geosciences. I was interested in Structural Geology, and suddenly I felt so much in love with Seismology, that I worked in solving focal mechanisms from seismic nests in subduction zones as my thesis. I then pursued a master in Geophysics & Geodynamics at the University of Oslo (Norway). There I worked on developing an automatic routine for detection and location of volcanic tremor signals using 2-years continuous data from a seismic network in East Java island (Indonesia).

Currently I’m now part of the SPIN network, working as a PhD candidate at the GFZ-Potsdam (Germany). Here my task is to understand the complex seismo-acoustic wavefield interactions at the vicinity of Mt. Etna volcano (Sicily), specifically focusing on non-linear elastic ground response triggered by volcanic explosions. For this purpose I use data from a deployed multi-instrumental network: broad-band seismic stations, infrasound sensors, and fiber optic Distributed Dynamic Strain Sensing (a.k.a DAS).

__Research progress__

We found evidence of possible non-linear elastic relation by associating the peak-to-peak (pp) pressure rate amplitudes from volcanic explosions (infrasound) with the associated pp amplitude of strain-rate signals in the ground from fiber optic sensing (Fig. 1). Despite fiber optics is an emergent sensing technique in seismology, it comes with signal artifacts which are imperative to understand so data can be processed correctly. Therefore me developed tools to assess features in fiber optic signals and experiments such as comparing 2 different types of fibers (Fig. 2) to understand better the instrumentation. This allowed us to assess our data correctly and overcome limitations of the initial acquisition parameters. As an example, we now able to restore original strain-rate values from saturated signals (Fig. 3) and use them for further analysis.

We also explored the advantages of stacking strain-rate data by interrogating interconnected fibers within the same cable. From Diaz-Meza et al. (2023).*</span>
