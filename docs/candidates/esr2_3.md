__Introduction__

My name is Foteini (pronounced Fotiní) and I’m from Thessaloniki, Greece. I graduated from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki with an integrated master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and I also hold a master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics from the University of Macedonia. After conducting research in wireless communications, non-intrusive load monitoring and machine learning both in academic and industry environments, I joined the SPIN ITN in
October 2022 as an early-stage researcher at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh and a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh. My PhD project concerns the development of machine learning based earthquake monitoring and forecasting workflows. I am excited to embark on this PhD project as it is a project at the intersection of machine learning, which is my area of expertise, and geosciences, which is a field that I am keen to delve into. During my free time I enjoy going for walks, playing tennis, cooking and reading.

Spatiotemporal rate, maximum magnitude and average depth sequences used to produce next-day rate forecasts. We identify events with magnitude 4 and above, create a square spatial grid around them and produce deep learning-based next-day rate forecasts using the rate, maximum magnitude and average depth maps of the previous 7 days as input. The neural network visualisation was created using http://alexlenail.me/NN-SVG/. BGS © UKRI 2025. Source: F.Dervisi et al. (2025), Earth, Planets and Space.
