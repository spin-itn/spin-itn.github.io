__Introduction__

I am Mahsa Safarkhani, PhD student of SPIN-ITN at the University of Hamburg. I completed my MSc in Geophysics at University of Tehran, Iran. The main focus of previous research concerned detecting and eliminating incoherent signals in order to retrieve the reliable and stable reference cross-correlation signals out of ambient seismic noise data. My interests and experiences in noise-based studies, large scale data analysis, signal processing, coherence-based techniques and microseisms encouraged me to continue my journey in the more challenging project. My PhD project concentrates on better understanding noise generation mechanisms and their effects on the cross-correlation wave fields to interpret the real changes in the Earth’s structure as accurately as possible. I am enjoying working in a professional environment which develops my aspiration to contribute to the road towards Earth science studies.
