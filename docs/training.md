# Training

---
Network-wide training will be offered in the form of short courses, workshops and a joint field deployment. More information to follow. 


> ### *coming soon...*

# Year 1: 

## "SPIN-up" 
kick off event

## Short Course 1 - Instruments & Wave propagation 
Establish same core background for all ESRs.

## Workshop 1 - New realms of seismic instrumentation
How can we accurately measure complete ground motion? 
New sensor concepts and first observations.

# Year 2: 

## Short Course 2 - Physics & dynamic processes                                                
Optimizing experiment design, and improving 
seismic inverse problems. 

## Workshop 2 - NEW physical models for Earth’s interior                     
Theoretical background to nonclassical nonlinear elasticity. 
Training on monitoring and understanding of the time-dependent behaviour of the Earth’s crustal materials.

## Attendance and presentation at International Conference

## Joint field deployment at CNRS-LSBB
Field experiment using different sensor types installed at same location (e.g. inside and on surface above laboratory facilities at LSBB, allowing for
a 3D deployment). 
**Goal**: cross-validation of methodology and observations with different instrumentation. 

# Year 3:

## Short Course 3 - “SPIN-off”  
Propel the network into the future. ESRs will team up with 
supervisors and invited key scientists to develop ideas for their 
own future postdoctoral research.

## Workshop 3 - Interrogating the restless Earth
How can we sharpen our images of changing subsurface 
properties? How do novel processing techniques help predict 
dynamic stresses inside the wavefield and their impact on the rock 
mass (e.g., induced events, poroelastic effects, damage and healing)? 

## Attendance and presentation at the International Conference

# Year 4:

## Short Course 4 - Outreach - The industry week       
“Life outside the ivory tower” - interaction with non-academics 
who could be future employers.

## Workshop 4 - New hazard monitoring strategies in Earth Sciences and beyond 
What is the impact of the SPIN developments on specific 
applications in the fields of natural hazards at national 
observatories, exploration seismics, engineering and beyond? 
How can SPIN research influence natural hazard policy?
**Goal**: develop a new set of best practices for hazard monitoring 
strategies, based on SPIN research results.
