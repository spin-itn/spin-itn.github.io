## Scientific Program

The "Interrogating the Restless Earth" short course will provide all of the mathematical theory and practical application experience that you need to get your particular Earth imaging, monitoring, or more generally interrogation project working in the real world. Taught as a 5 day retreat in an amazing and beautiful location in the Scottish Highlands, by top tier Geophysics professors from around Europe and beyond, this course will be divided between theory in the mornings and more practical exercises in the afternoons. To freshen up, each day there is time for rest, walks, cycling, visiting local attractions, or a range of other activities.

This Short Course is designed for post-graduate students undertaking Masters or Ph. D. level degrees, post-doctoral associates and fellows, and academic, governmental, industrial or other professional staff. Attendees will be expected to have a reasonable background in scientific mathematical methods at undergraduate level, as provided for example by an undergraduate degree in quantitative, physical scientific, engineering, mathematics or informatics.

## Practical exercises

## Schedule 

A preliminary schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DcfPWzSwqqhhH1ZFYfdOCANxjzUST5-Ikg274SABGw0/edit#).   
Note that the short course program in Pitlochry starts early morning on 20.03. A coach leaves from Edinburgh to the conference venue on 19.03 in the afternoon. It therefore makes sense to arrive in Edinburgh the morning of the 19.03.
