## Scientific Program
The SPIN Highland Retreat is a structured workshop designed to inspire new ideas in Earth dynamics and how to observe them. The workshop will create <b><i>ventures</i></b> (combined ideas, teams and plans), and we will start to work on those ventures in our venture teams during the workshop. Ventures could develop new research, businesses, public engagement, proposals or any other useful outcome from our combined scientific knowledge and experience. This should lead to a range of new and exciting directions and achievements from the SPIN Innovative Training Network and our collaborators.

## Arrival into Edinburgh
For arrivals by train into Edinburgh, the final destination will be <b>Edinburgh Waverley Train Station</b>, located in the centre of the city. If you are making your own way from Edinburgh to Pitlochry, there are connecting trains that can take you directly from Waverley. See [scotrail.co.uk](https://www.scotrail.co.uk/) for details on departures and ticket prices.

For those arriving via the airport, a bus or tram can be taken to reach the city centre. Both the tram and the Airlink 100 bus depart every 10 minutes from just outside the airport terminal exit and arrive at St. Andrew Square, just a few minutes walk from Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Tickets can be bought from vending machines next to the tram station if taking the tram, or directly from the bus driver if taking the Airlink 100.

More information about the provided bus from Edinburgh to Pitlochry will be provided soon.

There is an optional excursion offered on both the short course and workshop to a local whisky distillery: [Blair Athol Distillery](https://www.malts.com/en-gb/distilleries/blair-athol). On the short course this will be in the afternoon on the 23rd of March and on the workshop this will be on the afternoon of the 25th March. Attending the tour of the distillery will cost an additional £10.
You can find a map with the route to the distillery [here](/assets/images/ws3/Maps/Map_HotelGarden_EdradourDistillery.pdf).
