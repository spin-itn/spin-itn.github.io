## Scientific Program
The SPIN Highland Retreat is a structured workshop designed to inspire new ideas in Earth dynamics and how to observe them. The workshop will create <b><i>ventures</i></b> (combined ideas, teams and plans), and we will start to work on those ventures in our venture teams during the workshop. Ventures could develop new research, businesses, public engagement, proposals or any other useful outcome from our combined scientific knowledge and experience. This should lead to a range of new and exciting directions and achievements from the SPIN Innovative Training Network and our collaborators.

## Arrival into Edinburgh
For arrivals by train into Edinburgh, the final destination will be <b>Edinburgh Waverley Train Station</b>, located in the centre of the city. If you are making your own way from Edinburgh to Pitlochry, there are connecting trains that can take you directly from Waverley. See [scotrail.co.uk](https://www.scotrail.co.uk/) for details on departures and ticket prices.

For those arriving via the airport, a bus or tram can be taken to reach the city centre. Both the tram and the Airlink 100 bus depart every 10 minutes from just outside the airport terminal exit and arrive at St. Andrew Square, just a few minutes walk from Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Tickets can be bought from vending machines next to the tram station if taking the tram, or directly from the bus driver if taking the Airlink 100.

More information about the provided bus from Edinburgh to Pitlochry will be provided soon.

## Location and Venue

<img src="/assets/images/ws3/venue_banner.svg" alt="SPIN WS3 location: Pitlochry!" width="100%"/>

The workshop will take place north of Edinburgh, in the Scottish Highlands. More specifically, the venue is located in Pitlochry, right at a river next to the Cairngorms National Park.

The venue is the '[Atholl Palace Hotel
](https://www.athollpalace.com/)' located in the small village of Pitlochry.

Transport between Edinburgh and Pitlochry is arranged and will follow the times below:
- March 24th: 15:00 From Edinburgh Waverley train station to Pitlochry via the airport
- March 29th: 09:00 From Pitlochry to Edinburgh Waverley train station via the airport

To limit the carbon footprint of the meeting, we encourage you to travel by train and/or ferry if possible.

## Excursion and activities
Bring warm & water-proof clothes & sturdy walking boots/shoes!

There is an optional excursion offered on both the short course and workshop to a local whisky distillery: [Blair Athol Distillery](https://www.malts.com/en-gb/distilleries/blair-athol). On the short course this will be in the afternoon on the 23rd of March and on the workshop this will be on the afternoon of the 25th March. Attending the tour of the distillery will cost an additional £10.
You can find a map with the route to the distillery [here](/assets/images/ws3/Maps/Map_HotelGarden_EdradourDistillery.pdf). 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

There will be an opportunity for a free afternoon towards the end of the workshop to explore surrounding Pitlochry. Activities can include fishing, cycling, and a visit to Blair Atholl Castle or the Killiecrankie battle site.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

You will  find maps for two walks up nearby hills: [Faskally](/assets/images/ws3/Maps/Map_Faskally.pdf) and [Ben-Y-Vrackie](/assets/images/ws3/Maps/Map_Ben-Y-Vrackie.pdf).  
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## Accommodation
During the SPIN Short Course, you will stay at the hotel rooms in the conference venue. You do not need to reserve the rooms yourself, this will be part of the registration process.
Accommodation is all full board (the price includes breakfast, lunch and dinner), and both lunch and dinner will be vegetarian for everybody to reduce the climate impact of the event. There is an option to share a twin room or have a room to yourself.
The registration fee for the workshop will be approximately £175 (or £345 if you attend both the short course and the workshop).

The cost of rooms for the entire workshop is 
- £497.50 for sharing a twin room 
- £745 for a room to yourself

{: style="text-align: justify;"}

## Registration
Registration will open in January 2023.

__Would you like to attend the workshop?__   
Please pre-register for the workshop by filling in the survey here: [https://tinyurl.com/register-spin-ws3](https://tinyurl.com/register-spin-ws3).<br>

_Pre-registration closes on __February 8th__, and is necessary for all attendees._

We welcome participants from outside the SPIN network! However, note that the number of places for the workshop is limited, and will preferentially go to Early-Career Researchers (PhD or early Postdoc) who are able to provide a convincing motivation for participation.

If you would like to keep up to date on SPIN activities and future training events, please subscribe to the SPIN-info mailing list [here](https://mailman.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/mailman/listinfo/spin-info).
