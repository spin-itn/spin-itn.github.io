## Excursion and activities
During the workshop, two excursions will be offered.
The <b>Rheinschlucht</b> is one of Switzerland's most impressive natural reserves. The 13 km-long canyon is often advertised as the “Swiss Grand Canyon”. The area around the borders of the Rheinschlucht are showing various landscapes. You’ll find everything from steep mountain slopes to wide flood plains.

During the second excursion, you will have the opportunity to visit the <b>Cuolm da Vi landslide</b>. Ongoing studies are currently monitoring the landslide, aiming to understand better the processes that control the landslide’s behavior.

You will have some free time during the course. If you plan to explore the region during that time (or before/after the workshop), here is a link to some possible activities, such as finding crystals, visiting a monastery, or climbing:

## Accommodation
During the SPIN Workshop, you will stay at the hotel rooms in the conference venue. You do not need to reserve the rooms yourself, this will be part of the registration process.<br>
Accommodation is all full board (the price includes breakfast, lunch and dinner), and both lunch and dinner will be vegetarian for everybody to reduce the climate impact of the event. There will be an option to share a twin room or have a room to yourself. <br>
The estimated registration fee for the short course will be added soon.

## Registration
We welcome participants from outside the SPIN network!  <br>
Registration will open in January 2024. Note that the number of places for the workshop is limited, and will preferentially go to Early-Career Researchers (PhD or early Postdoc) who are able to provide a convincing motivation for participation. If you are selected for the short course happening before the workshop, you will also have priority for participation in the workshop if you pre-register for both.
