# __SPIN-ITN:__ Seismological Parameters and INstrumentation


SPIN is an Innovative Training Network (ITN) funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA).

## Monitoring a Restless Earth

_The seismic wavefield carries the imprint of material it crossed. We now understand that seismic wavefields alter the
material when they pass through it and that these changes are measurable. This is important, because the dynamic
response of Earth’s material directly afects our societies: geomaterial alterations are associated with many natural
hazards, such as volcanic eruptions, landslides, earthquakes, and the structural health of civil structures such as bridges and
buildings. Traditional seismic sensors - global and regional networks of seismometers - provide us with high temporal
resolution, but sparse spatial resolution._
{: style="text-align: justify;"}
 
_Right now, new sensing technologies (fiber-optic cables (DAS), large-N arrays, rotation sensors) are emerging that can give
us much more detailed spatial information about how the seismic wavefield behaves. This means that we can study
changes in local material properties, and investigate complex behavior of materials as they deform under small strain.
These sensing technologies are reaching a level of maturity where they can be incorporated into common seismological
observation practice._
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

_For this new era of seismological instrumentation and observation fundamentally new skills need to be developed. In SPIN,
we will train the next generation of scientists to develop novel views about the dynamic behaviour of Earth materials, and in
particular how to observe them with the revolutionary new sensing systems at hand. It is currently enigmatic how to
combine these sensor types to optimize resolution power. This research and training will impact the way we understand
solid Earth processes, how we interrogate the Earth’s geomechanical behavior, and the way we forecast natural hazards._

> <span style="color:#242fff;text-align: justify; display:block;">**1)** **fully integrating the latest ground-motion sensing technology.** We will develop survey designs that optimise this novel technology to **improve the monitoring of geohazards**. In SPIN, we devise laboratory experiments to test **new physical models** of wave propagation that include the complex response of Earth materials to stress, and perform numerical simulations to predict their effects across scales in the real Earth. We apply the new models of wave propagation, and the field observations from novel sensor types, to **detect and exploit time-dependent material changes to improve forecasting of real emerging natural hazards**.</span>

> <span style="color:#242fff; text-align: justify; display:block">**2)** creating a fertile environment to train a **new generation of unique European researchers** who can incorporate new sensor types into widespread, societally-relevant applications. In SPIN, we will educate broad and versatile researchers – in fundamental theory, the forefront of ground motion sensing technology, in monitoring system design, and in the interpretation and mitigation of natural hazards.</span>

SPIN will, for the first time, focus on [training](/training/) [15 Early-Stage Researchers](/recruitment/) (ESRs) in emerging measurement technologies, and the design of monitoring systems for precursory changes in material properties, all while optimizing observation strategies. The unique interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral [network](/consortium/) will enable ESRs to gain international expertise at excellent [research institutions](/beneficiaries/), with meaningful exposure of each ESR to [other disciplines and sectors](/partners/), thus going far beyond the education at a single PhD programme.

SPIN began on 01.03.2021 and will run for four and a half years, ending on 31.08.2025. 
The network is coordinated by Prof. Dr. C. Hadziioannou at the <a href="https://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en/geophysik/personen/hadziioannou-celine.html">University of Hamburg</a>.
