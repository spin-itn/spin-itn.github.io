__Earliest possible starting date__: September 1st, 2021

## General information

This PhD position is one of the 15 Early Stage Researcher (ESR) positions within the SPIN project.  SPIN is an Innovative Training Network (ITN) funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA). 
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

SPIN will focus on training 15 PhD candidates in emerging measurement technologies in seismology. We will research the design of monitoring systems for precursory changes in material properties, all while optimizing observation strategies. The unique interdisciplinary and inter-sectoral network will enable PhDs to gain international expertise at excellent research institutions, with a meaningful exposure of each PhD to other disciplines and sectors, thus going far beyond the education at a single PhD programme.

__Project description__

Oceans cover the 2/3 of the Earth and ocean bottom seismometer stations (OBS) are key instruments for monitoring the Earth’s activity. These stations are sensitive to earthquakes, but also to “noise” from ocean waves and currents, storms, hurricanes, landslides, marine fauna, human activities and cryospheric events.  They provide fundamental information on tectonic earthquakes, geological processes and the local structure beneath the station, while the noise can be used to monitor environmental parameters and changes in structure beneath the station.  First order noise sources are compliance, the ground response to infra-gravity waves passing above the stations, and tilt caused by ocean currents passing by the stations.  
The purpose of this PhD is to enhance our ability to extract environmental and seismological data from OBS records, by separating the noise into its component elements.  The PhD student will first develop innovative tools to analyze and separate the tilt and compliance signals from the OBS data. The approach will combine signal processing, physical understanding and machine learning algorithms. The student will then use the ”clean” signals for various applications in environmental, tectonic and structural seismology.    
Several OBS datasets have been acquired over the last years and the PhD student will focus on the RHUM-RUM experiment data, in which 50 OBSs were deployed for one year in the Indian Ocean around La Reunion island. To complement this dataset, the PhD student will also use data from new DAS (distributed acoustic sensor) sensors which can measure signals nearly continuously along an optical cable.
